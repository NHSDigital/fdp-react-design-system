## Trend Side‑Gating & Neutral (Purple) Points

This note explains why **early monotonic trend points that are still on the *unfavourable* side of the mean** now render in the **neutral purple special‑cause colour** (instead of immediately showing Improvement / Concern).

### What Changed

Previously a strictly increasing (or decreasing) 6‑point run would immediately colour as Improvement (or Concern) once the rule length threshold was reached, *even if those points had not yet crossed onto the favourable side of the mean*.

The engine now applies **side gating**:

| Rule Flag | Value Side vs Mean | Metric Direction (example: High is good) | Variation Icon | Colour |
|-----------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------|--------|
| `specialCauseTrendIncreasing` | Below mean | High is good | Neither (neutral special cause) | Purple |
| `specialCauseTrendIncreasing` | Above mean | High is good | Improvement | Blue |
| `specialCauseTrendDecreasing` | Above mean | High is good | Neither (neutral) | Purple |
| `specialCauseTrendDecreasing` | Below mean | High is good | Concern | Orange |

The same logic mirrors for *Low is good* (favourable side inverted). Neutral direction always yields `Neither`.

### Rationale

1. **Avoid Premature Conclusions** – A rising sequence while still below the mean has not yet demonstrated improved performance; classifying too early biases interpretation.
2. **Reduces False Celebrations / Alerts** – Analysts were previously seeing “Improvement” icons before any actual favourable shift materialised.
3. **Consistency With Other Side‑Sensitive Rules** – Shift and two‑of‑three logic already require being stably on one side of the mean; trend gating brings parity.
4. **Diagnostic Transparency** – Purple indicates *“emerging special cause pattern detected, but not yet favourable/unfavourable in outcome terms”*.

### Illustration (Dataset Story)

Below, view the story: the mid‑series increasing points (e.g. 17 & 18 January) are *still below the mean* so they are purple although the trend rule has fired. Once later points rise above the mean, Improvement (blue) icons appear.

### Under the Hood

Pseudocode of the gating step (conceptual):

```ts
for (const row of rows) {
  if (row.specialCauseTrendIncreasing) {
    const favourable = direction === 'Up' ? row.value > mean : direction === 'Down' ? row.value < mean : false;
    if (!favourable) row.variationIcon = 'neither';
  }
  if (row.specialCauseTrendDecreasing) {
    const favourable = direction === 'Up' ? row.value < mean : direction === 'Down' ? row.value > mean : false;
    if (!favourable) row.variationIcon = 'neither';
  }
}
```

### Test Coverage

Trend side‑gating behaviour is enforced by multiple tests:

| Test File | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `spc.trendSideGate.client.test.ts` | Core regression: trend while on adverse side stays neutral. |
| `spc.trendEdgeCases.client.test.ts` | Entire trend below elevated mean → no premature Improvement. |
| `spc.trendCrossMeanEdge.client.test.ts` | Crossing the mean: only post‑cross points classed as Improvement. |
| `spc.trendAlternatingMixed.client.test.ts` | Alternating / partial trends don’t leak Improvement/Concern early. |
| `spc.mixedPrecedence.client.test.ts` | Integrated scenario (trend + clusters + final opposite signal). |
| `__tests__/spc.ed4h.debug.test.ts` | Real metric regression (ED 4h) – blocks prior premature Improvement. |



### Summary

Purple trend points = **valid special cause detection** held in *neutral* state until outcome is evidenced by crossing the mean into the favourable zone. This preserves statistical sensitivity (rule still fires at 6 points) while delaying directional interpretation for better analytical accuracy.
