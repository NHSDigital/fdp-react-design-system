## SPC Rule Clash

There are 4 rules applied to a Statistical Process Control (SPC) chart; these are:

- Trend: a run of 6/7 points or more all consecutively

- 2/3: where there are 2 out of 3 points outside either the

- Shift: a run of 6/7 points or more above or below the mean.

- Single point: any single point outside the process limits.

The rules are ordered to prioritise the trend rule. The rules are applied in the following order:

1. trend

2. shift

3. 2 out of 3

4. single point

There are times when multiple rules are triggered at the same time, this can mean the coloured dots highlighting special cause variation for each rule are shown at the same time (see example below).

In the example below, down is improvement. Both the trend rule and shift rule have been triggered, you can only see the start and end of the shift rule because the trend rule takes priority, and the trend rule dots appear over the shift rule dots.
